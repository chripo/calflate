Welcome to Calflate
===================

*Calflate* is a command line application that **conflates** external 
*CalDAV* and *CardDAV* entries into another online collection. 
It does a one-way sync of calendar EVENTs, TODOs, JOURNALs and 
addressbook entries (VCARD) based on ``UIDs`` and ``SEQUENCE`` or 
``REV`` numbers.

*Calflate* is written in Python, it has no dependencies and is
licenced under the **FreeBSD License**. The source code and 
issue tracker is available at https://github.com/chripo/calflate.

    # verbose output
    # verbose = True
    
    # don't make changes
    # dryrun = True
    
    # replace UID pattern
    # uid_from = (.+?)@foobar.com
    # uid_to = \1
    
    # source calendar / addressbook
    src = https://source-host.net/test/events.ics/
    # src_user = username
    # src_pass = password
    
    # destination calendar / addressbook
    dst = https://my-server.net/user/calendar.ics/
